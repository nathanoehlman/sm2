# Steelmesh Platform Handlers

Steelmesh 1.0 was focused around a NodeJS application stack with the potential to integrate different replication mechanisms other than CouchDB.  Steelmesh 2.0, however, fully embraces the strength of CouchDB and simplifies the application loading logic to suit.

Additionally, the platform has been updated to work with languages other than just NodeJS applications.
