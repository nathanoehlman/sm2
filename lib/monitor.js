# Steelmesh Monitor

The SteelmeshMonitor process has the following responsibilities:

- monitoring couch for steelmesh application updates (via ChangeMachine)
- monitoring couch for application database updates (via ChangeMachine)

In previous versions of steelmesh the monitor process also took some responsibilty
for monitoring overall process and system health but this responsibility has now
been delegated to the Watchdog.

## Monitoring Application DB Updates

As steelmesh is designed to function primarily as a Node + CouchDB application 
platform it provides first class support for dealing with the Couch updates interface. 
While listening for steelmesh application updates (against the `steelmesh` db) is done
automatically, updates against other application databases is only done when requested 
by an application.

An application can register to listen for updates through the `couchdb` section in the
application configuration, e.g.

```js
couchdb: {
    // specify the target db
    lbs: {
        autoCreate: true,
        onChange: '/lbs-change'
    }
}
```
*/
function SteelmeshMonitor(server) {
    
}

util.inherits(SteelmeshMonitor, events.EventEmitter);

SteelmeshMonitor.prototype.start = function(callback) {
    callback();
};

module.exports = SteelmeshMonitor;
